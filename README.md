interactive profile cards using HTML and CSS, focusing on hover effects to enhance user experience.

## ðŸ”§ What I Practiced

- Built profile cards with a clean layout, including an image, name, and role.
- Used `object-fit: cover` to ensure images fill the card area without distortion.
- Applied rounded corners to cards and images using `border-radius`.
- Implemented a smooth box-shadow transition on hover to make cards stand out interactively.

## ðŸ“„ HTML & CSS Highlights

- Each card is a `.card` div containing an image and a description section.
- Card styles:
  - Fixed height and width for consistency.
  - Border and subtle rounded corners.
  - `transition` property for smooth shadow effect on hover.
  - `display: inline-block;` for horizontal alignment.
- Image styles:
  - Full width and fixed height.
  - `object-fit: cover` for proper image scaling.
  - Rounded top corners.
- On hovering a card, a prominent box-shadow appears, creating a modern interactive effect.

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- Combining `transition` and `box-shadow` creates engaging hover effects.
- `object-fit: cover` is essential for responsive and visually appealing images in cards.
- Well-structured cards improve both aesthetics and user interaction in web layouts.
